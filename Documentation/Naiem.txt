Giftap Project Documentation (Current Work Progress by Naiem Hasan)
Overview:
This document details the work completed by Naiem Hasan on the Giftap platform, an e-commerce system focused on gifting. The features implemented enhance user interaction, communication, and administrative management.

Features Developed:
1. User Authentication
Naiem implemented a robust user authentication system allowing for:
Login Methods:
Users can log in using their email and password.
Social login options with Google and GitHub have also been integrated for a seamless experience.
Sign-Up:
New users can sign up by providing their email, name, and password.
2. Navbar Section
To improve user experience and accessibility, the following features were added to the navbar:
Hot Offer Section: A dynamic section displaying ongoing offers, along with a countdown timer showing the time left until the offer ends.
Search Functionality: A search bar integrated into the navbar allows users to search for products across the platform quickly and efficiently.
3. User Dashboard
The user dashboard was created to provide users with control over their account settings and information:
Profile Update: Users can update their personal details, such as their name, email, and password.
Address Management: Users can add or update their shipping and billing addresses for a streamlined checkout process.
Seller Request: Users have the option to request seller status. These requests are displayed on the admin side:
Admins can approve or delete the requests.
Once approved, the user's role is updated to seller, granting them access to seller functionalities.
4. Live Chat System (Using WebSocket)
Naiem developed a live chat system using WebSocket technology to facilitate real-time communication:
User-Admin Chat: Currently, users can engage in real-time chat with admins for support or queries.
Upcoming Feature: The system will be extended to allow users to chat with sellers, enhancing buyer-seller communication.

Summary:
The work completed so far covers crucial aspects of the user experience, including secure authentication, easy navigation, personalized user dashboards, and real-time communication. Future work will focus on extending the chat feature to include seller communication and other enhancements to improve the platform further.
