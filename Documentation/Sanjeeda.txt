Order Details Access: Added functionality to allow users to click on an order to view detailed information, such as individual items, quantities, and delivery information.
Filter and Sort Options: Implemented basic filtering and sorting options to help users find specific orders based on date or status.
3. Wishlist Tab
Product Listing: Designed a wishlist tab that displays all items added by the user, including product images, names, prices, and availability.

Summary
In this update, I designed the user dashboard's tabs for order list and wishlist. The order list provides a detailed overview of the user's orders, with easy access to order details and filtering options. The wishlist tab displays saved products, allowing users to quickly add them to their cart or remove them from the list. These enhancements improve user experience by making order management and wishlist access more efficient and user-friendly.
