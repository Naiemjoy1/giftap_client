***********WEEK 3***************
Initial Plan and Development: "First, I made a plan with my team to decide on the style of our project and its key features. After that, I focused on creating the Blog and Contact pages.
Blog Page Design: On the Blog page, there is a list of blogs with a title, an overview of gift products, and a brief description. When users click on a blog post, they are directed to the blog details page. On this page, they can read the full article, see user comments, and view reviews.
For the design:
The Blog listing page features a clean layout with a card-based design for each post, showing the blog title, image, and a short excerpt.
The Blog details page has a minimalist design to keep the focus on the content. User comments and reviews are displayed in a collapsible or sectioned format for easy navigation.
Contact Page Design: The Contact page contains our team's contact information, along with a form where users can send us a message directly.
For the design:
The form is designed to be user-friendly with labelled fields (name, email, message) and a clear "Send" button.
A responsive layout ensures that users can easily view and interact with the form on both desktop and mobile devices.
Finally, I ensured that both pages maintain a consistent colour scheme, typography, and responsive design, providing a cohesive user experience across the entire site
